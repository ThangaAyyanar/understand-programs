* Decision statment

Decision statements are parts of a program that let it choose what to
do based on certain conditions. They help the program make choices and
follow different paths depending on whether something is true or
false.

You can use print statements to understand how if statements work. To
visualize decision statements, we can use flowcharts.

Let's explore a few examples of different decision statements using
print statements and flowcharts.

** Simple if

Execute the below program and check whether the decision statement
block is executed or not

#+begin_src java
class Sample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "hello";
	if (s.equals("hello")) {
	    System.out.println("True statement");	    
	}
    }
}
#+end_src

** Flow chart
