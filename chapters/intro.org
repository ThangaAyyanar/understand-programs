* Introduction

This book is designed for individuals with a basic understanding of
programming who may find complex concepts intimidating or struggle
with algorithms.

We won't cover the basics, such as variable declarations, if
statements, or for loops. Readers should already be familiar with
these fundamental concepts.

This book focuses on the Java programming language.

If you can run the program below on your system and see the expected
output, you can move on to Chapter 2.

#+begin_src java
class Sample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	System.out.println("Hello world");
    }
}
#+end_src

#+begin_example
Hello world
#+end_example
