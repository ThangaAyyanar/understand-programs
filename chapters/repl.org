* REPL

REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It is an interactive programming
environment that allows users to enter code, execute it, and see the
results immediately. REPLs are commonly used in various programming
languages for testing, debugging, and learning.

How REPL Works

- Read: The REPL reads the user's input (code).
- Eval: It evaluates the input, executing the code.
- Print: The result of the evaluation is printed to the screen.
- Loop: The process repeats, allowing the user to enter more code.
